# Road Safety Data Analysis Dashboard
Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing road accident data.
The dataset includes details such as accident date, severity, weather conditions, and location.
The dashboard visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) to help identify accident trends, severity distribution, and environmental factors influencing accidents.

Objectives
1. Explore and analyze road accident datasets.
2. Identify and track KPIs such as:
         Total number of accidents
         Accident trends over time
         Severity distribution
         Weather impact on accidents
3. Provide a visually appealing, interactive dashboard for better decision-making.

Tools & Technologies:
1. Power BI – Dashboard creation & data visualization
2. DAX – Calculations & measures for KPIs
3. Data Transformation – Cleaning and shaping data for analysis

Key Insights:
1. Accident frequency trends across months and years.
2. Severity breakdown to identify high-risk categories.
3. Impact of weather conditions on accident occurrence.
4. Location-based analysis for targeted safety improvements

How to Use:
1. Download the .pbix file from this repository.
2. Open it in Power BI Desktop.
3. Refresh the dataset if necessary to view updated visuals.
4. Interact with slicers, filters, and visuals to explore the data.

Future Improvements:
1. Integration with real-time accident data APIs.
2. Predictive analytics to forecast accident trends.
3. Adding drill-through pages for deeper analysis.
